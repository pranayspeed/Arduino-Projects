# ULN2003
A easy to use and to modify, documented library to drive a stepper using the generic ULN2003 stepper.

This library is made to run the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with the arduino and the often-used ULN2003 motor driver, with happens to be uncompatible with the standard <Stepper.h> library. It is quite optimized, and uses the same syntaxe as the standard library.
